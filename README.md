# Blockchain-Smart-Cities-IPFS
This project implementsof blockchain in smart ciies IPFS framework. It demonstrates how blockchain technology and IPFS can be integrated to enhance data security and privacy within smart cities. The project includes smart contract code that supports the framework, showcasing its application in various scenarios such as environmental disaster management, traffic management, and energy grid management
Key Features
Blockchain Integration: Utilizes blockchain technology to secure and manage data in smart cities.
IPFS Utilization: Leverages IPFS for decentralized data storage and retrieval.
Scenario Implementations: Includes practical implementations for environmental disaster response, traffic control, and energy management.
Smart Contracts: Contains smart contract code for managing transactions and ensuring data integrity.
Repository Contents
Smart Contracts: Code for deploying and managing smart contracts related to the project. (See contracts/ directory)
Scripts: Deployment and testing scripts for the smart contracts. (See scripts/ directory)
Documentation: Guides and explanations related to the framework and its components.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run and test the smart contracts, you need:

Node.js (v12 or higher)
Truffle Suite
Ganache (or any Ethereum local blockchain)

Deploy Contracts: Use Truffle to deploy the smart contracts to a local or test Ethereum network.
Interaction: Follow the documentation in the docs/ directory to interact with the contracts and integrate them into your application.
